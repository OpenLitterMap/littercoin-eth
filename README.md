## About Littercoin
Littercoin was first conceptualised in 2015 after the openlittermap founder was introduced to the concept of 
tokenisation during the openlittermap research.

By applying the proof-of-work principle to the production of real-world geographic information, the idea for
Littercoin was born. Unlike most monetary paradigms, Littercoin intends to be different.

Littercoin is created exclusively by real-people who are creating real data about real litter that is polluting a real
environment. Littercoin tokenises the production of geographic information, rewarding the concentration of human time
and energy for participating in citizen science. To earn a littercoin, simply upload 100 photos of litter to openlittermap
and you will be rewarded with 1 Littercoin.

Littercoin gets its value from a smart contract that holds crypto. If there are $100 worth of crypto in the contract
and 10 littercoin in circulation, then each littercoin will be worth $10.

However, if you earn a Littercoin you cannot send it to the smart contract. To achieve this, we introduce a new concept
to the crypto ecosystem called Merchant Tokens.

Unlike most currencies, Littercoin can only be spent with participating pre-approved green-listed zero-waste climate
merchants. Merchants can apply to accept Littercoin and if approved, they will receive a special Merchant NFT.
This token, which expires after 12 months, is required to send Littercoin to the Smart Contract to get the crypto out.

By sending crypto to the Smart Contract, users are rewarded with Reward Tokens. For every $1 worth of crypto, users
receive 1 OLMRewardToken. These do not have any purpose or value yet other than to give people a receipt and thanks
for their support.
